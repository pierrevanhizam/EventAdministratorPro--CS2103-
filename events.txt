Solo/Duet by T.H.E Dance Company
Drawing from varied facets of the contemporary Asian experience including specific events such as the recent Japanese earthquake and tsunami to the situations of daily life and relationships, three young choreographers who hail from different cities in Asia offer glimpses into their lives as urbanites through exciting new dance works created for solos and duets. Recognised for their cutting edge creativity in dance, our guest choreographers are Hong Kong-based Taiwanese Wu Yi-San - formerly with City Contemporary Dance Company; Davit from Indonesia – principal dancer and assistant to renowned choreographer Boi Sakti; and Singaporean Jeffrey Tan – former dancer and resident choreographer with Singapore Dance Theatre.
